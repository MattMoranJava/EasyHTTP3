    <h2>Easy Http version 3</h2>
    <p>This is another improved version of the previous Easy HTTP REST library, using the Async/Await functionality from ES7.<br />
    Currently this works in Chrome as of July 2018 but if you want it to work elsewhere you might want to compile this ES7 Javascript to ES5 using Webpack or similar.</p>
    <p>As before - inspect &amp; check the console: that is where the magic is at.</p>
